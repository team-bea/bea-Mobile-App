    {"question": "What are the treatments for breast cancer?",
      "answer": "There are different types of treatment for breast cancer. What is best for you depends on the type of breast cancer, and on your personal needs and situation. Your medical team will help you make decisions on your treatment. You can also request a second opinion from a different doctor. Surgery involves removing the affected breast and lymph nodes, or part of it. This is called a mastectomy. It may be followed by breast reconstruction. Radiation therapy uses high energy X-rays or other types of rays to kills the cancer cells in a localized area. Chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill or disable cancer cells. Hormone therapy is effective for types of cancer that need the presences of certain types of hormones to grow."},
    {"question": "What is breast reconstruction?",
      "answer": "After a mastectomy, you may opt for breast reconstruction performed by a plastic surgeon. This is a way to make your breast look more like before the surgery. It is a personal choice whether you want to have breast reconstruction or not. There are different ways to do the reconstruction and it may be done immediately after the mastectomy or at a later date, depending on your situation."}],
  "general": [{"question": "What is breast cancer?","answer": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. An uncontrolled growth of cells in the breast can cause a tumor. There are different types of tumors. Some are benign, they grow slowly, and they do not spread to other parts of the body. They are not considered cancerous. Malignant tumors grow rapidly and can spread to other parts of the breast and the body. They are considered cancerous."},{
    "question": "What are the different types of breast cancer?","answer": "There are several types of benign tumors of the breast. These benign breast conditions are not considered cancerous but can increase the risk of breast cancer. They include hyperplasia, cysts, fibroadenomas, etc. Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) develops in the milk ducts and the cells have not left this location. That is why it is called “in situ” (“in place”). It is often called “pre-invasive” or “pre-cancerous” because it has not yet spread but can develop into invasive cancer. Invasive breast cancer happens when cells have spread to nearby tissues in the breast. The first place where these cells will spread to are the lymph nodes under the arms. Metastatic breast cancer happens when the cancer cells have spread beyond the breast and the lymph nodes under the arms. It is not a type of breast cancer but a stage of breast cancer, the most advanced and dangerous (stage IV)."},
    {"question": "What are the risk factors for breast cancer?",
      "answer": "Several risk factors can lead to breast cancer. There are some factors which we cannot change like being a woman, getting older, and certain factors related to personal and family medical history. Other factors that can increase the risk of breast cancer are related to our lifestyle and thus in our control: alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet and weight gain, are all risk factors."},{
      "question": "What are the warning signs of breast cancer?",
      "answer": "Unusual changes to the breast are a warning sign of breast cancer and you should see a health care provider if any of these happen: a lump in the breast or underarm area; swelling of all or part of the breast; skin irritation or dimpling; breast pain; nipple pain or the nipple turning inward; redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin; a nipple discharge other than breast milk" }],
  "diagnosis": [{"question": "How is breast cancer diagnosed?","answer": "If you detect one or more of the warning signs of breast cancer or an abnormal area is found in a mammogram, some follow-up tests will be advised. Often it is not breast cancer, but these tests are the only way to know for sure. Some of the tests required to reach a breast cancer diagnosis are a diagnostic mammograph, breast MRI, breast ultrasound, and biopsy. Biopsies remove a few cells from the concerned area to be studied by a pathologist under a microscope. The outcome of this analysis is the pathology report, which you can translate with BEA. "},{"question": "What are the stages of breast cancer and how are they calculated?",
    "answer": "The stages of breast cancer go from 0 to IV (0-4). Stage IV (4) is cancer with metastases and is the most serious. The stage of your cancer is calculated by your pathologist with a system called TNM system. T = Tumor Size; N = Lymph Node Status (how many lymph nodes have cancer cells); M = metastases (if the cancer has spread to other parts of your body). Other measures have been added since 2018. These are the grade of the tumor from 1 to 3 (how similar the cancer cells are to normal cells and how fast the cancer cells are growing) and measures related to hormones (estrogen, progesterone), and proteins (HER2 status)."},{"question": "What will I find in my pathology report?","answer": "It’s always a good idea to get a copy of your pathology report for your record and to refer to it later. Below are the main components of the pathology report. Some of them may or not be present depending on your situation. Diagnosis is the most important part of the report. It will give you information on the size, type, grade, hormone sensitivity, margins, etc. of the tumor. It will also contain information on any lymph nodes impacted. The stage of the cancer may be included, but this is not always the case. Other information included is patient information, information on specimens and procedure, clinical history, etc."}],"followUp": [{"question": "What happens after my treatment is over?","answer": "Once your treatment is over, you will need to keep doing follow-up visits with your doctor to monitor any signs of recurrence of the cancer. Usually the visits are every 6 months in the beginning and then every year. It is important to tell your doctor if you notice anything abnormal."}]}
